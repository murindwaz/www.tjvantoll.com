Hi, I'm TJ. I'm a front-end developer, [tech author](#books), [speaker](/speaking), and a principal developer advocate for [Progress](https://www.progress.com). I have over a decade of web development experience, including a few years working on the [jQuery team](http://jqueryui.com/about/). Nowadays I spend my time helping web developers build mobile apps through projects like [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/). You can contact me on Twitter ([@tjvantoll](https://twitter.com/tjvantoll)), GitHub ([tjvantoll](https://github.com/tjvantoll)), or [via email](mailto:tj.vantoll@gmail.com).
