    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You may have seen Burke Holland's <a href="https://medium.com/@burkeholland/building-and-deploying-a-phonegap-app-in-36-seconds-6552399c12a8">"Building A PhoneGap App in 36 Seconds Using Nothing But a Browser"</a> article on Medium this morning. Although most people probably viewed the post as an interesting—and surprisingly fast—way of building an app, I saw the article as a direct challenge.</p>

<p>You see, although I work with AppBuilder in the browser from time to time, I prefer the AppBuilder CLI. And with the CLI, I can put Burke's 36 second time to shame. Below I build a PhoneGap app, performing the same steps Burke did, in TEN seconds:</p>

<h3>Full Disclosure</h3>

<ul>
<li>This was done using the <a href="https://github.com/Icenium/icenium-cli">Telerik AppBuilder CLI</a>.</li>
<li>I did <strong>NOT</strong> speed up the screen capture.</li>
<li>I <strong>DID</strong> practice this a few times.</li>
<li>I <strong>DID</strong> have to lookup the syntax for the <code>sed</code> command, because it makes no sense.</li>
<li>I <strong>DID</strong> use the <a href="http://www.telerik.com/appbuilder/companion-app">AppBuilder Companion app</a>, which I had pre-installed on my iPhone.</li>
<li>I <strong>DID</strong> rely on the Bash history for speed, which I deem fair, because that's a thing CLIs do.</li>
</ul>


<p>With the AppBuilder CLI installed (<code>npm install -g appbuilder</code>), and with the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/telerik-appbuilder/id527547398?mt=8">AppBuilder iOS app</a> installed, you can run this yourself with the following four commands:</p>

<p><code>
$ appbuilder create hybrid gif --template=Blank
$ cd gif
$ sed -i '' 's/Apache Cordova/gif/g' index.html
$ appbuilder livesync ios --companion
</code></p>

<p>What's really cool is that as of <a href="http://blogs.telerik.com/appbuilder/posts/14-07-02/telerik-appbuilder-release-sharing-projects-cordova-update-nativescript-preview-and-more">the last AppBuilder release</a>, you can now share your code across the AppBuilder clients. That means, I can collborate on Burke's project from the CLI, and he can collaborate on mine from the browser—which I think is pretty cool.</p>
