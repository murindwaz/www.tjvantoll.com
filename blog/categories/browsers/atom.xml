    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Opera <a href="http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/300-million-users-and-move-to-webkit">announced Wednesday</a> that they are moving from their Presto rendering engine to WebKit.</p>

<p>The reaction I saw from most developers was mostly positive - one less rendering engine to support.</p>

<p>And yes, having one less rendering engine to support will make the lives of web developers easier.  But the loss of one of the web's core four rendering engines represents a slippery slope towards a WebKit monoculture.</p>

<h3>WebKit - Our New Overlords?</h3>

<p>On desktop there's still a healthy distribution between the 3 remaining rendering engines.  According to <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-ww-monthly-201201-201301">StatCounter</a>, as of January 2013 Trident (Internet Explorer) has 30.7% of the market, Gecko (Firefox) has 21.4%, and WebKit picks up the rest:</p>

<p><img src="http://tjvantoll.com/images/posts/2013-02-14/statcounter-desktop.png"></p>

<p>On mobile however, the loss of Presto gives WebKit a near monopoly:</p>

<p><img src="http://tjvantoll.com/images/posts/2013-02-14/statcounter-mobile.png"></p>

<p>WebKit is, or will be, the rendering engine behind all browsers listed other than the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UC_Browser">UC Browser</a>.  Gecko and Trident's mobile browsers are not even popular enough to be put in the key.</p>

<p>This is concerning.</p>

<h3>Why is One Rendering Engine Bad?</h3>

<p>There seems to be a perception amongst web developers that if we had one rendering engine our lives would be so much easier.  And after years of wrestling with asinine browser differences this view is understandable.  But there are some fundamental problems with a single rendering engine having a monopoly.</p>

<h4>Standards</h4>

<p>With one rendering engine the line between bugs and standard behavior becomes blurred.  The only way developers have to verify correctness is to refer to the appropriate specification.  And standardization is less likely to happen in the first place.  For better or worse, when there is one rendering engine its behavior becomes the standard.</p>

<p>Tools are already being developed that target WebKit exclusively.  The following is from <a href="http://html.adobe.com/edge/">Adobe's Edge tools</a>:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>"Because you design in an environment based on WebKit, your content will display reliably across modern browsers and mobile devices."</p></blockquote></p>

<p>This sort of language is detrimental to Gecko and Trident's chances of being relevant, especially on mobile.</p>

<h4>Competition</h4>

<p>Competition drives innovation.  Fewer rendering engines means less competition.</p>

<h4>Proprietary</h4>

<p>Have you ever used window.showModalDialog?  It's an API <a href="http://tjvantoll.com/2012/05/02/showmodaldialog-what-it-is-and-why-you-should-never-use-it/">riddled with issues</a>, yet, it is now <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/timers.html#dialogs-implemented-using-separate-documents">standardized in the HTML5 specification</a>.</p>

<p>Why?  When IE6 had a virtual monopoly on the browser world, a lot of applications were written that depended on the API.  And once an API is used on the web, it's almost impossible to change or remove it.</p>

<p>For WebKit this is less of a concern than it was with IE6, but there are still a lot of WebKit specific features that are not part of any specification (<a href="http://peter.sh/experiments/vendor-prefixed-css-property-overview/">prefixes</a>, for example).</p>

<h3>Business</h3>

<p>From a business perspective Opera's move is an inevitability.  With the complexity of web browsers rapidly approaching Skynet, keeping up with a rendering engine that is backed by the likes of Google, Apple, Adobe, Nokia, RIM, and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/09/apple-and-google-still-lead-webkit-development-but-more-smaller-companies-contributing/">many more</a> is fighting a losing battle.</p>

<p>With Opera throwing their support behind WebKit as well, my primary concern is that it will become increasingly difficult for Gecko and Trident to keep up.</p>

<h3>Optimism</h3>

<p>Despite this, I don't believe all is doom and gloom by any means.  This is not IE6 all over again.  WebKit is an open source project whose contributors are active participants in the web standards community.</p>

<p>It's also important to remember that <a href="http://quirksmode.org/webkit.html">not all WebKits are created equally</a>, WebKit browsers are fighting to distinguish themselves; innovation in the browser world has never been as strong as it is today.</p>

<p>That being said, the loss of a rendering engine is still a sad day for the web.  R.I.P. Presto.</p>

    <link href="http://tjvantoll.com/2013/01/28/stop-messing-with-the-browsers-default-focus-outline/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-28T20:57:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://tjvantoll.com/2013/01/28/stop-messing-with-the-browsers-default-focus-outline</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the latest in my series of accessibility best practices after getting frustrated with using a keyboard on the internet.  Last time I talked about <a href="/2013/01/01/enter-should-submit-forms-stop-messing-with-that/">enter submitting forms</a>, this time I'm going to explain why removing the browser's default focus <code>outline</code> is a bad idea.</p>

<h3>Focus Rings</h3>

<p>All browsers have a default value they apply to the currently focused item.  For example Chrome on OS X uses the following:</p>

<p>``` css
:focus {</p>

<pre><code>/* -webkit-focus-ring-color = '#5B9DD9' */
outline: -webkit-focus-ring-color auto 5px;
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Firefox uses a <code>1px dotted #212121</code> outline, other browser use other values.  The focus ring looks like this for Chrome on OS X:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2013-01-28/default.png" title="Default Focus Ring in Chrome on OS X" alt="Default Focus Ring in Chrome on OS X" /></p>

<p>Keyboard users <strong>depend</strong> on this <code>outline</code> to determine where they are on the page.  I cannot stress <strong>depend</strong> enough, without the <code>outline</code> you have no idea where you are.  Don't believe me?  Go to <a href="http://www.cnn.com">cnn.com</a> right now.  Hit tab a few times and try to figure out where the hell you are on the page.</p>

<p>The <code>outline</code> <em>can</em> be removed with the following:</p>

<p>``` css
:focus {</p>

<pre><code>outline: 0;
/* or */
outline: none;
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>This is obviously bad per the reasoning above.  The HTML5 specification has the following to say about removing the default <code>outline</code>:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>"...if an alternative focusing style isn't made available instead, the page will be significantly less usable for people who primarily navigate pages using a keyboard, or those with reduced vision who use focus outlines to help them navigate the page."</p><footer><strong>HTML5 Specification</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/editing.html#element-level-focus-apis'>www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<h3>Custom Focus Outlines</h3>

<p>As the spec mentions, you can create your own styling for focused items instead of using the browser's default.  For example the following will change all focused links to white text on a black background:</p>

<p>``` css
:link:focus, :visited:focus {</p>

<pre><code>outline: none;
background-color: black;
color: white;
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Although this is possible, I would <strong>strongly</strong> recommend simply leaving the default browser <code>outline</code> in place.  Changing the default display messes with a user's expectations, which is a big usability no no.  Furthermore, you need to make sure that whatever alternative you put in is sufficiently identifiable for users with reduced vision.</p>

<h3>Why do People Want it Removed?</h3>

<p>At the <a href="http://jqueryui.com">jQuery UI</a> project we get a <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/898">lot</a> <a href="http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8959">of</a> <a href="http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6146">requests</a> to remove the browser default <code>outline</code>s from our widgets.</p>

<p>  The most recent tickets have come from the <a href="http://jqueryui.com/slider">slider</a> and <a href="http://jqueryui.com/tabs">tabs</a> widgets.  This is what they look like on the latest Chrome on OS X:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2013-01-28/slider.png" title="Focus ring on jQuery UI slider" alt="Focus ring on jQuery UI slider" />
<img src="/images/posts/2013-01-28/tabs.png" title="Focus ring on jQuery UI tabs" alt="Focus ring on jQuery UI tabs" /></p>

<p>Some people find this unsightly.  Others are thrown off by the fact that the display varies on different browsers / operating systems.  While these concerns are reasonable, they do not outweigh the importance of the <code>outline</code> for keyboard users and users with reduced vision.</p>

<p>jQuery UI does nothing to alter the browser's default <code>outline</code> on these widgets and I encourage others to do the same.</p>

<h3>CSS Reset</h3>

<p>Unfortunately one of the reasons much of the internet removes the default focus ring is because the <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/reset200802.css">first version of Eric Meyer's CSS reset</a> included the following:</p>

<p>``` css
/<em> remember to define focus styles! </em>/
:focus {</p>

<pre><code>outline: 0;
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>As you can see it's made abundantly clear that you should define your own focus styles, but most people simply copied and pasted the file without realizing this.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/index.html">updated version</a> of the CSS reset no longer features this, but sadly it's a bit too late for a lot of sites.</p>

<p>Sigh.</p>

    <updated>2013-01-09T21:27:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://tjvantoll.com/2013/01/09/html5-hidden-attribute-browser-support</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had trouble finding this from a Google search, so I thought I'd list the browser support for the <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/editing.html#the-hidden-attribute">HTML5 hidden attribute</a> here.</p>

<p>IE still does not support the <code>hidden</code> attribute as of IE 10.  For any unsupported browser you can easily add support by just including the following CSS:</p>

<p><code>css Polyfiling the hidden attribute.
[hidden] { display: none; }

<p>This will work back to IE6, which doesn't support the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/Attribute_selectors">attribute selector</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://tjvantoll.com/2013/01/05/is-it-safe-to-use-the-body-as-a-top-level-container-yet/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-05T14:21:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://tjvantoll.com/2013/01/05/is-it-safe-to-use-the-body-as-a-top-level-container-yet</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>View source on almost any web page and you'll likely see the following:</p>

<p>``` html Common HTML Template
<html></p>

<pre><code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div id="wrapper"&gt;
        &lt;!-- All the things --&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></html>
```</p>

<p>The use of a wrapper or container <code>div</code> around the page is fairly universal.  It is commonly used to perform tasks such as centering a page's content or providing a shadow or border to frame it.  But, since the <code>body</code> element is a necessity in the markup, why can't it be styled directly instead?  Why is a wrapper <code>div</code> used?</p>

<p>Historically there have been a number of issues with using the <code>body</code> element as a top level container in old versions of Internet Explorers.  If you're supporting IE >= 8 you're good, but there are some things <a href="#now">you should be aware of</a>.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>IE 5.5</h3>

<p>To get to the origins of the wrapper <code>div</code> let's go way back.  A pretty common practice is to center the top level container using <code>margin: 0 auto</code>, and this works fine in all browsers... back to IE 5.5.  IE 5.5 did not support <code>auto</code> margins so this approach did not work.</p>

<p>To center the top level container in IE 5.5 you had to make use of <code>text-align: center</code> as such:</p>

<p>``` css Centering the top level container in IE 5.5
body {</p>

<pre><code>text-align: center;
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<h1>wrapper {</h1>

<pre><code>width: 1000px;
text-align: left; /* counteract the declaration on body */
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p><code>text-align: center</code> <em>should</em> only affect inline elements, but IE 5.5 incorrectly applied it to block elements as well.  (Note: The <code>text-align: center</code> bug was fixed in IE6 standards mode, but the behavior remained in Internet Explorer's quirks mode to this day.)</p>

<h3>IE6</h3>

<p>IE6 implemented <code>auto</code> margins, so <code>margin: 0 auto</code> was now safe to use on the <code>body</code>.  Additionally, IE6 fully supports adding a <code>width</code>, <code>padding</code>, <code>margin</code>, and <code>border</code> to the body element.  Take the following CSS:</p>

<p>``` css
body{</p>

<pre><code>width: 90%;
border: 2px solid red;
background-color: black;
color: white;
padding: 10px;
margin: 0 auto;
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>The layout renders the same in IE6 as it does in the latest version of Chrome (23 as of this writing).</p>

<div style="overflow: hidden;">
    <div style="float: left; width: 49%;">
        <h4>IE6</h4>
        <img title="Styling the body element in IE6" src="http://tjvantoll.com/images/posts/2013-01-05/IE6.png">
    </div>
    <div style="float: right; width: 49%;">
        <h4>Chrome</h4>
        <img title="Styling the body element in Chrome" src="http://tjvantoll.com/images/posts/2013-01-05/Chrome.png">
    </div>
</div>


<p>Believe it or not using the <code>body</code> element as a top level container is actually safe in IE6.</p>

<p><a name="zoom"></a></p>

<h3>IE7</h3>

<p>If there are no issues with IE6 why am I still writing?  IE7 introduced a feature new to Internet Explorer, zoom, and with it came a new bug.</p>

<p>When a <code>margin</code> or <code>width</code> is applied to the <code>body</code> and the user zooms, IE7 incorrectly treats the left edge of the <code>body</code> as the edge of the viewport.  This shift bumps content on the right hand side of the page outside of the screen.  The image below shows the result of a zoomed in window and styled <code>body</code> in IE7.</p>

<p><img src="http://tjvantoll.com/images/posts/2013-01-05/IE7Zoom.png" title="Zooming in IE7" style="max-height: 400px;"></p>

<p>This issue is not present using a wrapper <code>div</code>.</p>

<h3>Beyond IE7</h3>

<p>In my testing beyond IE7 there are no major issues using the <code>body</code> element as a top level container.  There are however a few things to be aware of.</p>

<p><a name="now"></a></p>

<h3>Positioning</h3>

<p>Any absolutely positioned elements will be positioned relative to the viewport rather than the newly placed <code>body</code>.  To fix this set <code>position: relative</code> on the <code>body</code> as such:</p>

<p>``` css Positioning elements relative to the body rather than the viewport
body {</p>

<pre><code>margin: 0 auto;
width: 90%;
position: relative;
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<h3>Backgrounds</h3>

<p>Backgrounds applied to the <code>body</code> will take up whole page regardless of margins.  Consider the following:</p>

<p>``` css
body {</p>

<pre><code>background: black;
margin: 0 auto;
width: 200px;
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>The screenshot below shows this.  The background of the entire viewport is black rather than a centered 200px block.</p>

<p><img src="http://tjvantoll.com/images/posts/2013-01-05/background-before.png" title="background on a body element" style="max-height: 300px;"></p>

<p>This can be worked around by applying a <code>background</code> on the <code>html</code> element:</p>

<p>``` css
html {</p>

<pre><code>background: white;
height: 100%;
</code></pre>

<p>}
body {</p>

<pre><code>background: black;
margin: 0 auto;
width: 200px;
min-height: 100%;
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Note the <code>height</code> that was added to the <code>html</code> element and the <code>min-height</code> added to the <code>body</code>.  This ensures that the <code>background</code> applied to the <code>body</code> element will take up the entire height of the screen.</p>

<p>The rules above will now render as expected:</p>

<p><img src="http://tjvantoll.com/images/posts/2013-01-05/background-after.png" title="background on a body element with background on html element" style="max-height: 300px;"></p>

<h3>scrollHeight and scrollWidth</h3>

<p>In WebKit based browsers the <code>body</code>'s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/element.scrollHeight">scrollHeight</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/element.scrollWidth">scrollWidth</a> properties are unaffected by declared <code>height</code> and <code>width</code> styles.  For example:</p>

<p>``` html scrollHeight and scrollWidth on the body element
<html></p>

<pre><code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body style="height: 200px; width: 200px;"&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
        console.log(document.body.scrollHeight);
        console.log(document.body.scrollWidth);
    &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></html>
```</p>

<p>This will log <code>200</code> for both in all modern browsers with the exception of WebKit based ones.  WebKit will return the height and width of the viewport.</p>

<p>While you are unlikely to run into this directly, you may use a library that does.  For example, this <a href="http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8940">causes an issue</a> trying to constrain <a href="http://jqueryui.com/draggable/">jQuery UI draggables</a> within the <code>body</code>.</p>

<h3>Is it Safe to Use Yet?</h3>

<p>The <a href="#zoom">zoom issue in IE7</a> is bad, but if you're no longer supporting IE7 it's safe to drop the wrapper <code>div</code> and style the <code>body</code> directly.</p>

<p>That being said, there's no harm in leaving a wrapper <code>div</code> in place.  So if you have any doubt stick with <code>&lt;div id="wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Know of any other bugs with styling the <code>body</code> element?  Let me know in the comments.</p>

    <link href="http://tjvantoll.com/2012/11/10/creating-cross-browser-scrollable-tbody/"/>
    <updated>2012-11-10T15:44:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://tjvantoll.com/2012/11/10/creating-cross-browser-scrollable-tbody</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>By default the <code>overflow</code> CSS property does not apply to table group elements (<code>&lt;thead&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;tfoot&gt;</code>).  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Firefox_4_for_developers#Miscellaneous_CSS_changes">As of Firefox 4</a> this behavior is consistent across all browser implementations.</p>

<p>Therefore, if you attempt to apply a CSS <code>height</code> and <code>overflow: scroll</code> to a <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> it will have no effect in modern browsers.  You can see this for yourself <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/vU494/">here</a>.</p>

<p>But having a scrolling table body with fixed headers is a useful UI element, so how do you work around this?</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>The Solution</h3>

<p>Here is my solution:</p>

<p><pre class="codepen" data-height="400" data-type="result" data-href="JEKIu" data-user="tjvantoll"><code></code></pre>
<script async src="http://codepen.io:/assets/embed/ei.js"></script></p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

<p>The first step is to set the <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> to <code>display: block</code> so an <code>overflow</code> and <code>height</code> can be applied.  From there the rows in the <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code> need to be set to <code>position: relative</code> and <code>display: block</code> so that they'll sit on top of the now scrollable <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>That's really about it.</p>

<h3>Unfortunate Part #1: Old Internet Explorer</h3>

<p>When you set a <code>height</code> on a <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> Internet Explorer &lt; 10 applies that <code>height</code> to every table cell, which is of course wonderful.</p>

<p>My workaround for this is to conditionally create a wrapper <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.  When it's present I give it the <code>height</code> and <code>overflow</code> and remove the <code>height</code> from the <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>``` html Wrap table for IE</p>



<!--[if lte IE 9]>
<div class="old_ie_wrapper">
<!--<![endif]-->


<pre><code>&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;!-- Contents of the table --&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<!--[if lte IE 9]>
</div>
<!--<![endif]-->


<p>```</p>

<p>The headers will scroll with the table body, but the table will at least be usable.  You could also create <a href="http://paulirish.com/2008/conditional-stylesheets-vs-css-hacks-answer-neither/">conditional classes on the &lt;html&gt; tag</a> to handle this as well.</p>

<h3>Unfortunate Part #2: Widths</h3>

<p>Because the <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code> is relatively positioned each table cell needs an explicit <code>width</code>.</p>

<p><code>css
td:nth-child(1), th:nth-child(1) { width: 100px; }
td:nth-child(2), th:nth-child(2) { width: 100px; }
td:nth-child(3), th:nth-child(3) { width: 100px; }
</code></p>

<p>But unfortunately that is not enough.  When a scrollbar is present browsers allocate space for it, therefore, the <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> ends up having less space available than the <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code>.  Notice the slight misalignment this creates:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2012-11-10/Alignment-Issue.png" title="Alignment issue with scroll bar" alt="Alignment issue with scroll bar" /></p>

<p>The only workaround I could come up with was to set a <code>min-width</code> on all columns except the last one.</p>

<p><code>css
td:nth-child(1), th:nth-child(1) { min-width: 100px; }
td:nth-child(2), th:nth-child(2) { min-width: 100px; }
td:nth-child(3), th:nth-child(3) { width: 100px; }
</code></p>

<h3>The Good</h3>

<p>Despite these issues the solution does work in all browsers back to IE6 with no JavaScript dependency.</p>

<p>The markup to create the table is simple and semantic.  I've seen workarounds for this issue that use <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s instead of <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>s or multiple aligned <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>s and those always felt dirty to me.</p>

<p>The code is free to use and do whatever you want with it.  If you have any suggestions for improvements or find any issues please let me know in the comments.</p>
