I own over 40 technical books, and consider many of the them vital to my tech career, but the process behind tech books has always been a bit mythical to me. So when Manning Publications contacted me about writing a book on jQuery UI, curiosity was one of the reasons I said yes. (With the other reasons being a fanboy-like passion for jQuery UI and masochistic tendencies.)

Since I personally considered the process behind tech books magic, and I now know it all works (at least for Manning), I thought I'd share.

## What it's like to write a tech book

Let's start with a short timeline of my work on *jQuery UI in Action*:

* **April 29th, 2013**: Manning first contacts me
* **June 26th, 2013**: I signed a contract to write the book
* **August 1st, 2013**: I started writing chapter 1
* **March 26th, 2014**: I completed the first draft of the entire book
* **September 12th, 2014**: All reviews and edits were complete
* **September 30th, 2014**: *jQuery UI in Action* is released

As you can see, the entire process took about 17 months, and the core writing time was about 8 months. What was going on during the rest of the time? Well, I'll break the process down into three phases.

### Phase 1: Getting started

The first chunk of time was me deciding whether I was going to write this thing, as I had some idea of the gravity of this commitment. That's what I was doing for most of May and some of June in 2013. After that I spent some time outlining and formatting the contents of the book.

Before I wrote a word Manning sent my proposal—a document I wrote that outlined the book—to a large group of prospective readers in the community. The purpose of this was twofold. First, Manning didn't want to invest in a book the the community has no interest in, and therefore won't sell. Second, the community gave feedback on what they *are* interested in, which I was able to use to shape the book. What I heard was a clear demand for more intermediate to advanced material on jQuery UI, and a desire to see jQuery UI applied to real-world scenarios, which I took to heart as I started writing. Here are a few pieces of feedback I got at random:

> I would be very interested in learning more about “how” jQuery UI works (more than just copy and paste this snippet and you have magic).

> Most books of this nature lack depth. Good developers want to know how something works not just how to use it.

> What the competition is sorely lacking is strategies for putting together more complex user interfaces. As a reader, I am more interested in how to build apps than in isolated examples of various widgets.

> jQuery UI is widely used so I believe it would benefit from a meatier book on the subject, one that explains the rationale behind the framework and does not shy away from explaining core decisions and inner workings.

### Phase 2: Writing the thing

*jQuery UI in Action* contains twelve chapters and six appendices over 361 pages, the vast majority of which were written over eight months, much of which I've repressed for my own sanity, as it was an insane amount of work.

</p>

One thing I learned about authoring book is that the overwhelming majority of people that write books do so on top of having a full-time job. Basically you have to be a name like Stephen King to have the ability to write without having other gigs. I have met many other tech authors since I started writing mine, and every single one of them wrote their books after hours.

I also had a full-time job throughout the process, so I tried to find time to write whenever I could. Because I have three-year-old twins that keep me busy during the day, I did a lot of my writing at night. On average I tried to work on the book **two hours a day, seven days a week**. I would occasionally take a day off, and I would occasionally get in a few extra hours, but overall I was fairly consistent about working **~14 hours per week** on the book.

One *huge* advantage I had was an extraordinarily flexible day job. I work as a developer advocate for Telerik, and I do so from my basement.

</p>

Working remote affords me a little extra time everyday, and I was able to use that time to work on the book periodically, which turned out to be invaluable. What I usually did was do logistical things related to the book during the day—answering emails, performing edits, responding to reviews, and such—so that I could devote my nights to writing without distractions.

### Phase 3: Editing, editing, and more editing

Any writer will tell you that writing a book is only half the story, and they're right. My book went through a dizzying set of review passes, including, but not limited to the following:

* External reviews by ~8 individuals at three points throughout the book (after chapters 4, 8, and 12 were completed, respectively)
* A copy edit pass for grammar and formatting
* A dedicated technical review
* Two proofreading passes

	<i>I'm good at the grammar.</i>
</p>

Each pass through the chapters brought either feedback for me to incorporate, or changes for me to review. A bunch of small changes doesn't seem like it would be that hard, but as it turns out, it is. The first problem is whenever you make a change you have to put yourself back in the mindset you were in when you originally quote

## Tips for writing a book

Based on my experiences with *jQuery UI in Action* I'll offer the following unsolicited tips to current and future authors of tech books.

### Tip #1: Write, write write


The first draft of anything is shit.

Write drunk; edit sober.

### Will I write another book?

Don't write unless it's something you're extremely passionate about

Don't write a book for the money

Drink

Write. Write. Write.
Sleep on it—aka write when you can
Tips on writing in Word
First pass, don’t worry about any formatting.

Grammar stances
No spaces around em dashes
lowercase after colon
No Oxford comma


### Why write a book on jQuery UI 2014

I know, jQuery UI is sooooo 2010. But that attitude is actually one of the reasons I want to write the book. There are some anti jQuery UI sentiments that I agree with—aka the look is visually dated—and others that I vehemently disagree with—such as the complaint that jQuery UI is bloated.
