Recently some minor [RSI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury)
-like symptoms in my right hand have forced me to re-evaluate my day to day computer usage.  Since the symptoms are exclusively in my right hand, I decided to start by restricting my mouse usage as much as possible.

To discourage my mouse using tendencies, I decided to only use the mouse left-handed.  After a few minutes I found that my current repertoire of keyboard shortcuts did not meet my new mouse-free workflow.

To build my keyboard portfolio, I've been accumulating a list of shortcuts I find handy near my desk.  I thought I'd post the list here in case others might find them useful.  This list is not intended to be comprehensive; these are merely shortcuts that I have found helpful.

## Applications

Being a Windows 7 user in a previous life, I miss [its really nice set of keyboard shortcuts to manage windows](http://www.techspot.com/blog/283/windows-7-improved-window-management-using-the-keyboard-hotkeys/).

To help fill the gap on OS X, I've been using a 3rd party application, [Divvy](http://mizage.com/divvy/).  It allows you to assign custom keyboard shortcuts to resize and align windows.  I use `Control` + `Command` + `Space Bar` to activate Divvy.  From there I have the following keys to resize windows predefined:	

* `D` → Dominant, left 5/6 of the screen
* `S` → Sidebar, right 1/6 of the screen
* `T` → Top half of screen
* `B` → Bottom half of screen
* `L` → Left half of screen
* `R` → Right half of screen
