I'm excited to announce that I'll be joining [Telerik](http://telerik.com) as a Developer Advocate for [Icenium](http://icenium.com). I've been doing a lot of [speaking](/blog/archives/) and [writing](/speaking/) in my free time, and this opportunity will give me a chance to do that as part of my day job.

While I'm excited, I'm also sad to leave behind some great people at [Liquid Web](http://liquidweb.com). They were a great company and a fun place to work, but at the end of the day getting paid to speak and write has been a goal of mine, and this was an opportunity I couldn't pass up.

I'll be talking at two events in October - [DevReach](http://www.devreach.com/) and [HTML5DevConf](http://html5devconf.com/). If you're going to be there make sure to stop by and say hi.
